 <p>Even students who are just learning to write, such as kindergartners, can benefit from understanding the structure of a paragraph. As they progress into the later years of elementary school and middle school, they can begin to create paragraphs that include all of the necessary elements. Once a student reaches high school, they should be able to write a paragraph that has a distinct thesis and also includes supporting arguments.</p>
